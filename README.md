# Python-Code-Dryrunner
Get a step by step dryrun of your python code.
Writing the dry run of a code manually is a tedious task especially for beginners in programming . This project gives a dry run of the python code entered by user to analyse the changes occuring with the execution of each line. 

Ace editor is integrated into the frontend for taking user input.
<br>The frontend uses Fetch API to send the code entered to the backend and receive back the execution trace.
<br>Backend uses the Django framework and executes the python program under supervision of the standard python debugger module(bdb) .
<br>Programâ€™s runtime state at every executed line is recorded and a JSON execution trace is sent back , which the frontend renders as the dry run.<br>

Frontend Files : index.html <br>style.css<br>front.js <br>visualize.js<br>

front.js sends the user input to backend and receives output trace .<br>
visualize.js renders the trace as the dry run<br>


Backend: <br>
views.py - Receives the data from frontend . Sends it to logger.py. Sends the data received from logger.py back to frontend.<br>
logger.py - Runs the python program under bdb debugger module and produces output trace. Calls encoder.py to encode data structure.<br>
encoder.py - Adds data structure created / updated in the trace.<br>
